# k - spare beds for visiting kittens
# Note that a kitten will only come if it can stay the whole time it wants to borrow a spare bed.

# Input:
# n and k (1≤𝑘<𝑛≤100000), the number of potential visiting kittens and the number of beds.
# Then follow n lines, each containing two integers 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖, meaning that kitten 𝑖 wants
# to arrive at time 𝑥𝑖 and leave at time 𝑦𝑖.
# This means that two kittens 𝑖 and 𝑗, where 𝑦𝑖=𝑥𝑗, can use the same bed, as one kitten leaves
# at the same time as the other arrives. You may assume that 0≤𝑥𝑖<𝑦𝑖≤1000000000.

# Output
# Output the maximum number of kittens that can be housed given the requests.
